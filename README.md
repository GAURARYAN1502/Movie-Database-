The Movie Database project is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an external API. It allows users to search for movies, view details such as the plot, release date, ratings, and cast, and browse popular or trending films. The project demonstrates API integration by fetching real-time movie data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API and displaying it in a clean, user-friendly interface. Responsive design techniques are implemented to ensure the site works seamlessly across both desktop and mobile devices.
